As a delegate, I want to help keep the Gnosis Safe secure and user-friendly as it spins out of the broader Gnosis ecosystem. You can trust me to read every single proposal, participate in every vote, and weigh in on decisions as much as possible.

I have a background in smart contract security (previously audited Open Zeppelin, dYdX, Augur, and more) as well as a background in contract-based accounts (previously cofounded Authereum). I trust the Safe contracts because I have personally audited them and have an intimate understanding of contract-based accounts, much of which I learned from studying the Safe contracts during the early days Authereum. As a delegate, I pledge to always put security first in every DAO decision and will weigh in on governance decisions from a technical standpoint when needed.

I have also been a Gnosis Safe user for the past 2.5 years.

- I personally use a Gnosis Safe to secure the majority of my funds.
- A Gnosis Safe secures our team's funds at Hop.
- A separate Safe secures a portion of Hop DAO's funds.
- We used a Safe to secure Authereum's funds.

The Gnosis Safe is a product that I use multiple times a week, and as a delegate, you can trust me to push for user experience improvements that will drive wider adoption and secure the Gnosis Safe as the goto evm-compatible multisig wallet.

Lastly, I pledge to always vote in the best interest of the Gnosis Safe DAO and community. I will vote No on proposals that do not move the Gnosis Safe's core mission forward.
